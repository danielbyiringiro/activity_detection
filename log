- Generated a project overview to help me have a clear mental picture of the project

  Next Steps
- Find existing implementations of video activity detection

[Day 2]

- Found multiple implementations.
- Started checking (one)['https://github.com/noorkhokhar99/human-activity-recognition/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file']
- Was not able to run it.
- Issue: the opencv I have on my kaggle does not come compiled with GPU support.
- Solution: 1. Run the code on collab
            2. Build opencv locally with GPU colab
